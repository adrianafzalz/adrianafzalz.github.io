        <p class="text2">I'm a third semester student majoring in Informatics at the Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember
            (ITS) in
            Surabaya. Born September 2005 in Surabaya.
            Has a persistent personality and never gives up. Has good time management skills. Has interest in Artificial
            Intelligence, Web Developing and Game.
            Since i started coding, i'm fascinated because of how complex coding was. <br><br>At the beginning of my
            learning journey i feel like
            its too hard for me, But this actually made me even more curious. I spent hours experimenting, reading, and
            trying to figure out how things worked.
            In that time every small success felt like a huge achievement for me. I think my biggest strength is that I
            wont give up. I don't like leaving
            problems unsolved, so I'll try to solve the challenge until I figure it out. College definitely taught me a
            lot about patience and
            managing my time well, especially when i get multiple projects. It's been a journey of learning not just
            about algorithms and code,
            but also about how I work best and what truly keeps me motivated.
