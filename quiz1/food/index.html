            <p>TLontong Balap is a culinary specialty of Surabaya, East Java, consisting of pieces of lontong, boiled bean sprouts, 
                fried tofu, and lentho (peanut patties), topped with fresh sauce, and accompanied by petis chili sauce, sweet soy sauce,
                 fried onions, and shrimp crackers. It is called “balap” because the vendors used to carry their wares quickly, giving the impression of racing. This dish is often paired with clam satay and coconut ice drink.

            </h1>
            <p> Rujak cingur usually consists of slices of several types of fruit, such as cucumber, krai (a type of 
                cucumber typical of East Java), jicama, young mango, pineapple, kedondong, and is added with lontong, tofu, tempeh, 
                bendoyo, and cingur, as well as vegetables such as bean sprouts, kangkung, and long beans. All of these ingredients 
                are mixed with a sauce or seasoning made from processed shrimp paste, boiled water to thin it slightly, sugar/brown 
                sugar, chili, fried peanuts, fried onions, salt, and thin slices of young green bananas (pisang klutuk). 
                All the sauces/seasonings are mixed by grinding, which is why rujak cingur is also often called rujak uleg.
